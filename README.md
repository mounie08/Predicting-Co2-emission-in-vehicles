Predicting Co2 emission in vehicles

The goal of the project is to predict the amount of CO2 emitted by a vehicle.
The main steps in the project are:
1. Download the dataset.
2. Preprocess or clean the data.
3. Analyze the pre-processed data.
4. Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
5. Save the model and its dependencies.
6. Build a Web application using flask that integrates with the model built.
